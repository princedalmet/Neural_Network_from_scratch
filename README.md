# Neural_Network_from_scratch

In this project a simple 2-layer neural network (input layer, hidden layer, output layer) for binary classification i'm implementing neural network from scratch.

The main goal was to create a neural network without using high-level frameworks like PyTorch or TensorFlow just using basic Python and NumPy.

The main parts include the architecture (layers, neurons), forward propagation, activation functions, loss computation, backpropagation, and parameter updates.

In forward propagation I have included matrix multiplications between inputs and weights, adding biases, and applying activation functions for the loss I have used cross entropy
